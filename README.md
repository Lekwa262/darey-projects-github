Cybersecurity Evolution: A Student's Perspective

Early Days (Pre-Internet)

1960s: ARPANET Creation and security: Early network protection
1970s: ARPANET Vulnerabilities: Early network security challenges.
1980s: Brain Virus & Early Antivirus: Beginnings of defenses.
Lessons: These early days exposed the vulnerability systems, data & institutions as a result increase in malware activities. And the need for intentional efforts to protect systems and data online

Internet Era (1990s-2000s)

1990s: Firewalls & IDS: Basic network protection emerges.
1995: SSL/TLS & E-commerce: Secure online transactions begin.
1999: ILOVEYOU & Melissa Worms: Rapid spread of email viruses.
2000s: Rise of Botnets & DDoS: Network disruption becomes a major threat.
2003: SQL Slammer & Database Attacks: Exploiting vulnerabilities in critical systems
2004: PCIDSS standards introduced: Industry data security standards was set
Lessons: First anti-virus invented while large scale online disruption became a major threat â€“ reveal- ing vulnerabilities and the NEED for setting industry standards in order to protect data online.

Modern Threats (2010s-Present)

2010s: APTs & Targeted Attacks: Sophisticated, long-term attacks.
2011: Stuxnet & Industrial Security: Attacks on critical state infrastructure.
2013: Snowden Leaks & Privacy: Increased awareness of data surveillance.
2014: Heartbleed & Shellshock: Widespread vulnerabilities exposed.
2016: Spear Phishing: Data theft & publishing on different web pages to disrupt USA elections.
2017: WannaCry & Ransomware Boom: Ransomware becomes a major criminal enterprise.
2020s: AI in Cyber Defense & Attacks: Machine learning for threat detection and attack automation.
2020s: Zero Trust & Cloud Security: Shifting security models for modern infrastructure
2020s: Quantum Computing & Cryptography: Future of secure communication.
2021: Malware attacks: On USA fuel pipeline showing the vulnerability of national infrastructures
2023: AI driven social engineering: Increase of targeted attacks using convincing AI generated content.
Lessons: This era saw the advent of state sponsored attacks. Hence the concepts of the CIA Triad, authentication & authorization, risk management., industry standard compliance, incident response and forensic investigations became critical for the security of systems and data online.
